# Mining-Quality-Prediction
This is a practical project to anticipate the percentage of silica concentration in the iron ore concentrate each minute using deep learning and machine learning models. This is generally used in mining industry. This project is taken from the course project of "Mining Quality Prediction Using Machine & Deep Learning" in coursera. The tasks we willl follow :

Understand the Problem Statement
Import libraries and datasets(Apply Python libraries to import)
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform Data Visualization(Apply Python libraries to visualize dataset)
Create Training and Testing Datasets(Split and Standardize training and testing dataset)
Train and Evaluate a Gradient Boosting Regressor Model
Train and Evaluate a Decision Tree Regressor Model
Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor Model
Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model(To perform regression tasks)
Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs( KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, adjusted R2)
